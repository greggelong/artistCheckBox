## an artist selection app

the artists will be selected based on criteria such as Artist Practice  medium technique  themes
social commentary etc

as the animals are chosen on the basis of habitat and color and number of legs

the createList( ) function 
This code checks if any of the selected properties match with the artist, and if so, the artist is included in the matchingArtists array. This allows for artists to match with any selected property rather than all selected properties.



the createList2() function 

This code will only include artists in the matchingArtists array if they match all the selected properties.


the createList3() function 

This function will only return artists who match all the selected properties, regardless of whether other properties are selected as well.



Sure, here's the updated list:

1. **Inclusive Matching:** Any selected property allows for inclusion.
2. **Strict Matching:** All selected properties must match.
3. **Partial Matching with Optional Properties:** All selected properties must match, but other properties can be present without affecting the match.
